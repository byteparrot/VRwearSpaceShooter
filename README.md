Android VR space shooter controlled with a smartwatch
# Info
The problem of simple VR setups (therefore when only using a headset and no other external components) are the limited control mechanisms. One possibility to control the VR application is by using another device an increasingly number of people are using: a smartwatch. In this project, we want to experiment with various input methods of the watch to navigate and control a VR application. We especially want to focus on touch and motion gestures. To demonstrate the input methods, we are building a simple game set in space, in which the user controls a spaceship and fight off incoming asteroids.
We use the Android ecosystem to develop the apps (Android Phone and Android Watch) and the Unity Game Engine to develop the game.
