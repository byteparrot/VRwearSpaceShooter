Android VR space shooter controlled with a smartwatch
# Info
The problem of simple VR setups (therefore when only using a headset and no other external components) are the limited control mechanisms. One possibility to control the VR application is by using another device an increasingly number of people are using: a smartwatch. In this project, we want to experiment with various input methods of the watch to navigate and control a VR application. We especially want to focus on touch and motion gestures. To demonstrate the input methods, we are building a simple game set in space, in which the user controls a spaceship and fight off incoming asteroids.
We use the Android ecosystem to develop the apps (Android Phone and Android Watch) and the Unity Game Engine to develop the game.

The App is available on the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.fhooe.pro2
